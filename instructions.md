# **1. Plan the Structure**

Define the main components of the app:

- **`Book` Class**:
  - Represents individual books with attributes like `title`, `author`, and possibly `genre` or `year`.
- **`Library` Class**:
  - Manages a collection of `Book` objects.
  - Implements methods for adding, removing, searching, and displaying books.

---

### **2. Create the `Book` Class**

1. Define a class `Book` to represent each book.
2. Add properties such as:
   - `id`: A unique identifier for the book (e.g., use `Math.random()` or a counter).
   - `title`: The book's title.
   - `author`: The authorâ€™s name.
   - Optional: Add properties like `genre`, `year`, or `isRead` for more functionality later.

---

### **3. Create the `Library` Class**

1. Define a class `Library` to manage the collection of books.
2. Add a property `collection`, which will hold the list of `Book` objects.
3. Implement the following methods:
   - **`addBook(book)`**: Adds a new book object to the collection.
   - **`removeBook(bookId)`**: Removes a book based on its unique `id`.
   - **`searchBook(query)`**: Searches for books by `title` or `author`.
   - **`displayBooks()`**: Logs or displays the list of books.

---

### **4. Connect the Classes**

- Ensure the `Library` class can store and manipulate multiple `Book` instances.
- Use aggregation (a `Library` object contains a list of `Book` objects).

---

### **5. Build a Simple UI**

1. Add an HTML structure with:
   - A form for users to input book details (`title`, `author`, etc.).
   - A list or table to display the books.
   - Buttons for actions like removing a book or marking it as read.
2. Use a `DOMElement` class or helper methods to:
   - Render the list of books dynamically.
   - Handle form submissions to add new books.
   - Attach event listeners for remove or search functionality.

---

### **6. Test the Core Functionalities**

- Hardcode a few `Book` objects and add them to the `Library`.
- Test the following:
  1. Adding new books.
  2. Searching by title or author.
  3. Removing books.
  4. Displaying the collection.

---

### **7. Extend Functionality (Optional Enhancements)**

If you complete the core features, consider adding:

1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort books alphabetically by title or by author.
2. **Mark as Read**:
   - Add a property `isRead` to `Book` and a button to toggle it.
3. **Category Filtering**:
   - Allow users to filter books by genre or other attributes.

---

### **Focus on OOP Principles**

1. **Encapsulation**:
   - Keep properties and methods relevant to each class (e.g., `Book` focuses on book details, `Library` manages the collection).
2. **Aggregation**:
   - Use the `Library` class to aggregate multiple `Book` instances.
3. **Modularity**:
   - Keep responsibilities separate. For example:
     - `Book` handles individual book properties.
     - `Library` manages the book collection.
     - A potential `DOMElement` class handles rendering and UI logic.
